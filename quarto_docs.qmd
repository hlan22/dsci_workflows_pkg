## Execution Options for `.qmd` and `.Rmd`

| Execution Option | Description | Values |
|-------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `eval` | Evaluate the code chunk (if false, just echos the code into the output). | `true` <br> `false` |
| `echo` | Include the source code in output. | `true` <br> `false` <br> `fenced` |
| `output` | Include the results of executing the code in the output. | `true` <br> `false` <br> `asis` (raw markdown, without Quartoâ€™s standard enclosing markdown) |
| `warning` | Include warnings in the output. | `true` <br> `false` |
| `error` | Include errors in the output (note: errors won't stop document processing). | `true` <br> `false` |
| `include` | Prevent any output (code or results) from being included. | `true` <br> `false` |

## Other introductory information

* Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

* Quarto sets up the metadata at the start with 3 dashes at the top of the file. If you move it after/later in the document, it will not understand.

* The notation at the start is yaml, keys and values, just like github actions files

* markdown is a short cut version of html, but you can always write pure html in a document too

If you want the proper coloring to show up for code, but not actually run it, you can do:

```r
myfunc <- function(blah) {
   blah + 1
}
```

But it doesn't define it!

```{r}
myfunc <- function(blah) {
   blah + 1
}

myfunc(3)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| include: false
#| 
```

These execution options are yaml key/value combinations, that is why it is false instead of FALSE (not r code, it is yaml).

* The reason we say echo - whatever you tell me, i'll spit back to you

* what about word wrapping? it is still considered line 9

You can turn off soft wrap long lines, but I don't like that option.

If you think about it from a git perspective, you have to find the change in the giant 5-line sentence.
That is why you can split up sentences, but as long as there is no space inbetween the sentences, they are rendered as one.

* Semantic line breaks; strategically breaking lines so that it is easier for version control
