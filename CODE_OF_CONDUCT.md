# `wordplay` Code of Conduct

## Diversity and Inclusivity
We are dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity.
As such, we do not tolerate behavior that is disrespectful to our group members that excludes, intimidates, or causes discomfort to others.
We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment based on characteristics that include, but are not limited to,
gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, citizenship, nationality,
ethnic or social origin, pregnancy, familial status, veteran status, genetic information, religion or belief (or lack thereof),
membership of a national minority, property, age, education, socio-economic status, technical choices, and experience level.

Everyone who contributes or participates in the project is required to conform to this Code of Conduct.
Each member is expected to assist with the enforcement of the Code of Conduct.

## Expected Behavior
Everyone is expected to show respect and courtesy to others.
All interactions should be professional regardless of platform: either online or in-person.
In order to foster a positive and professional environment we encourage the following kinds of behaviors in all events and platforms:
- Use welcoming and inclusive language
- Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accept constructive criticism
- Focus on what is best for the community
- Show courtesy and respect towards other community members
Note: See the four social rules for further recommendations.

## Unacceptable Behavior
Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants at any event/platform include:
- written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership of any specific group
- causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking, following, or intimidation
- violent threats or language directed against another person
- the display of sexual or violent images
- unwelcome sexual attention
- nonconsensual or unwelcome physical contact
- sustained disruption of talks, events or communications
- insults or put downs
- sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary jokes
- excessive swearing
- incitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm
- continuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording) with someone after being asked to stop publication of private communication without consent

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior
Anyone who is asked to stop any inappropriate behavior are expected to comply immediately.
This applies to any events and platforms, either online or in-person.
If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct,
a group member may warn the offender and/or investigate the Code of Conduct violation and impose appropriate sanctions.

## Incident Reporting Guidelines
If someone violates the Code of Conduct at any time, or in an online space outside of organised project work time,
a group member will report the violation(s).
