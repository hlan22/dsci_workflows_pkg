# DSCI 310 Final Exam Review

The main topics for the final exam are workflows and making a package. This repo is my notes that collect and synthesize information from the textbook, class, and external resources.

### Final Exam Information

* The best way to study is to look though the in-class examples, individual assignments, and be comfortable with all the mechanics you were asked to do for your milestone assignments.
* Think of the final as an individual assessment for everything you were asked to do for the project milestones.
* You will have 2 hours for the exam. For reference, it took [the professor] just under 30 minutes to get though it.
* Below is the instructions that you will see before the exam. The format is the same as the midterm.

### Final Exam Instructions

Welcome to your final exam for the course!

#### Topics Covered:

1. Interact with Git + GitHub with branches and pull requests.
2. Split a monolithic report into separate scripts.
3. Use a Makefile to run your analysis code.
4. Add functions and unit tests to a package.
5. Create a functioning R package.

##### Exam Notes

* This exam will have you use an exam template repository to practice the skills we have covered in class this term.
* You will not be building a full report or full package from scratch. We have provided a skeleton for you to work with.
* AI / LLM / ChatBots are allowed for the exam
* You are not allowed to communicate or collaborate with another human / classmate during the exam.

##### New Skill Necessary

There may be a new mechanics you will need to get access to the exam, specifically copying a template repository into the organization.

If this is new to you and you want an example to practice for:

1. Go to <https://github.com/DSCI-310/template-repository-example>
2. Click the green "Use this template" button
3. Select "Create a new repository"
4. Leave the "Include all branches" unchecked.
5. Set the ownership to your own account, rename the repo as needed - For the exam, you will use the course organization and have a specific repo name for the exam
6. Treat this "template" that you have copied into your account as a new repository. It is pre-populated with files so you are not starting from a completely empty repository.

### Credit

Although this repo is made by Heidi, credit goes towards Daniel Chen and other contributors for the DSCI 310 course for most material in the repo.
Thanks!
