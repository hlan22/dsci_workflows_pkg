Note: to get the most use out of Makefiles, ensure that you have already split up the code into different R scripts and reference them in the main report.

## Makefiles & Purpose

Makefiles have a lot of different uses! Here are the main ideas we will review:

1. Making a website
2. Running Code
3. Compiling a report
4. Terminal commands


#### Making a Website

The following Makefile:

* renders your website (from the `docs/` folder)
* ensures there is a `.nojekyll` file
* gives you the ability to clean your repo after rendering

```
.PHONY render clean

# render your website, make sure .nojekyll file exists
render:
	quarto render
	touch docs/.nojekyll

clean:
	rm -rf _site
	rm -rf docs
```


#### Running Code

#### Compiling a report

#### Terminal commands

## `docopt` Package

Using the library `docopt`, you can make your reports incredibly more reproducible! Instead of reading in your data for each script, or even `source()`-ing other scripts, you can instead use the `docopt` library to pass by this.
