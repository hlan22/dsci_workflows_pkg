    "text": "use_package()\nYou will inevitably want to use a function from another package in your own package. We will need to use package-specific methods for declaring the other packages we need (i.e. our dependencies) and for using these packages in ours. If you plan to submit a package to CRAN, note that this even applies to functions in packages that you think of as “always available”, such as stats::median() or utils::head().\nOne common dilemma when using R’s regular expression functions is uncertainty about whether to request perl = TRUE or perl = FALSE. And then there are often, but not always, other arguments that alter how patterns are matched, such as fixed, ignore.case, and invert. It can be hard to keep track of which functions use which arguments and how the arguments interact, so many users never get to the point where they retain these details without rereading the docs.\nLet’s imagine you decide you’d rather build your package using the stringr (and stringi) package than base R’s regular expression functions.\nFirst, declare your general intent to use some functions from the stringr namespace with use_package():\nuse_package(\"stringr\")\nThis adds the stringr package to the Imports field of DESCRIPTION. And that is all it does.\nLet’s revisit function-name() to make it more stringr-like.\nHere are some changes to include:\n\nRename the function to str_split_one(), to signal that it is a wrapper around stringr::str_split().\nAdopt the argument names from stringr::str_split(). Now we have string and pattern (and n), instead of x and split.\nIntroduce a bit of argument checking and edge case handling. This is unrelated to the switch to stringr and would be equally beneficial in the version built on strsplit().\nUse the package::function() form when calling stringr::str_split(). This specifies that we want to call the str_split() function from the stringr namespace. There is more than one way to call a function from another package.\n\nBut now we need to rename the function file based on the new function name!\nBecause this comes up fairly often in real life, we have the rename_files() function, which choreographs the renaming of a file in R/ and its associated companion files below test/.\nrename_files(\"function-name\", \"new-function-name\")\nHere are the updated contents of R/str_split_one.R. In addition to changing the function definition, we’ve also updated the roxygen header to reflect the new arguments and to include examples that show off the stringr features.\n#' Split a string\n#'\n#' @param string A character vector with, at most, one element.\n#' @inheritParams stringr::str_split\n#'\n#' @return A character vector.\n#' @export\n#'\n#' @examples\n#' x &lt;- \"alfa,bravo,charlie,delta\"\n#' str_split_one(x, pattern = \",\")\n#' str_split_one(x, pattern = \",\", n = 2)\n#'\n#' y &lt;- \"192.168.0.1\"\n#' str_split_one(y, pattern = stringr::fixed(\".\"))\nstr_split_one &lt;- function(string, pattern, n = Inf) {\n  stopifnot(is.character(string), length(string) &lt;= 1)\n  if (length(string) == 1) {\n    stringr::str_split(string = string, pattern = pattern, n = n)[[1]]\n  } else {\n    character()\n  }\n}\nDon’t forget to also update the test file!\nBefore we take the new str_split_one() out for a test drive, we need to call document(). Why? We need to regenerate the NAMESPACE file to include the new imports.\nDon’t be dismayed by the warning about \"Objects listed as exports, but not present in namespace: function-name\". That always happens when you remove something from the namespace.\ndocument()\nTry out the new str_split_one() function by simulating package installation via load_all():\nload_all()\nstr_split_one(\"a, b, c\", pattern = \", \")",

Luckily we don’t necessarily have to author that directly.\nWe write a specially formatted comment right above function-bame(), in its source file, and then let a package called roxygen2 handle the creation of man/function-name.Rd.\nIf you use RStudio, open R/function-name.R in the source editor and put the cursor somewhere in the function-name() function definition. Now do Code &gt; Insert roxygen skeleton. A very special comment should appear above your function, in which each line begins with #'. RStudio only inserts a barebones template, so you will need to edit it to look something like that below.\nYou should modify it to look something like this:\n#' Split a string\n#'\n#' @param x A character vector with one element.\n#' @param split What to split on.\n#'\n#' @return A character vector.\n#' @export\n#'\n#' @examples\n#' x &lt;- \"alfa,bravo,charlie,delta\"\n#' strsplit1(x, split = \",\")\nstrsplit1 &lt;- function(x, split) {\n  strsplit(x, split = split)[[1]]\n}\nBut we’re not done yet!

This playground lets your explore, experiment and test in a safe place - away from others that might be using or depending on the current version of your code.\nThis is perhaps more obviously useful if your project is deployed and has users (e.g., a data visualization dashboard, an R or Python package, a phone app, etc), but this can also be useful for code that make up a data analyses. Because, in addition to the reasons stated above for branching, branching also lets you organize units of work into smaller, more manageable chunks that are easier for collaborators to check over and review.\nSeveral branch playgrounds can co-exist, one for each new code addition or fix being worked on. This allows for parallelization of work!\n\n\n\nCreating a pull-request:\n\nTo create a pull request, you click the green button Compare & pull request. In the new page, add a message to describe the changes you have made, scroll down to review the changed files, and the click the green button that reads Create pull request. If you are working together in a team, you could also designate certain team members to review your work and assign relevant labels, via the right hand side panel.\nThe next step is for a collaborator to review your work and merge it in if they approve it.\nTutorial 2 is all about creating branches and pull requests. It also makes you create two branches and see the conflict when you try and pull them both despite them editing the same place. This ends in a merge conflict that you can solve in the github interface.",

If a GitHub remote is detected when use_readme_rmd() is called, this section is pre-filled with instructions on how to install from GitHub.\nShow a bit of usage.\n\nHow to populate this skeleton? Copy stuff liberally from DESCRIPTION and any formal and informal tests or examples you have. Anything is better than nothing. This is helpful because people probably won’t install your package and comb through individual help files to figure out how to use it.\nWe like to write the README in R Markdown, so it can feature actual usage. The inclusion of live code also makes it less likely that your README grows stale and out-of-sync with your actual package.\nTo make your own edits, if RStudio has not already done so, open README.Rmd for editing. Make sure it shows some usage of str_split_one().\nThe README.Rmd we use is here: README.Rmd.\nDon’t forget to render it to make README.md! The pre-commit hook should remind you if you try to commit README.Rmd, but not README.md, and also when README.md appears to be out-of-date.\nThe very best way to render README.Rmd is with build_readme(), because it takes care to render with the most current version of your package, i.e. it installs a temporary copy from the current source.\nbuild_readme()\nYou can see the rendered README.md simply by visiting regexcite on GitHub.",

When this script runs, it exits and the container exits to give you your prompt back\n\n\nAn R Container\nWith this code you can run an R container:\ndocker run --rm -it rocker/r-ver:4.3.2\nYou can open up and launch R or run R --version to get your current R version.\n\n\nAn RStudio Container\nWith this code you can run an RStudio container:\ndocker run --rm -e PASSWORD=\"pizza\" -p 8787:8787 rocker/rstudio:4.4.2\nHere are what the commands mean:\n\n--rm means remove. It is saying to delete the container when I am done with it!\n-e stands for environments. It lets you pass in special parameters necessary to run that container.\n-p stands for port. It is where you specify the container will be run through on your computer.\n\nAfter running it, you can visit http://localhost:8787 and view the RStudio container.\nIf you create any files in this container instance, all your work will be lost!\n\nAn RStudio Tidyverse Container\nYou can also make a Tidyverse container, where tidyverse is already installed! Pretty sweet.\ndocker run --rm -e PASSWORD=\"pizza\" -p 8787:8787 rocker/tidyverse:4.4.2\nNote that if you run two sessions at once, you will need to change the port mapping on one of them.\n\nhttp://localhost:8888 is commonly known for jupyterlab\n\n\n\n\nDockerFiles\nA Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image.\nYou can create it simply with the command code Dockerfile.\nIt is a special type of file, so make sure it does NOT end with something like .txt or .sh or anything. It is simply just Dockerfile (with a capital D).\nThe following is a sample of what you can do with a Dockerfile:\nFROM rocker/rstudio:4.2.2\n# this builds the base image from rstudio\n\n# you can run basic bash commands that will run while setting up the container\nRUN echo \"Hello\"\nRUN pwd\n\n# you can install apps and such so that you have them in your image\nRUN apt-get install -y git\n\n# you can copy files onto your image/container\nCOPY renv.lock /home/rstudio/renv.lock\nCOPY README.md /home/rstudio/README.md \n\n# we can even install packages into the image\nRUN Rscript -e \"install.packages('renv', repos = c(CRAN = 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))\"\n# with the renv package we can keep r packages in our image without having to manually download them each time\n# we have to set the working directory first\nWORKDIR /home/rstudio\n# then we can copy other project files\nCOPY renv/ /home/rstudio/renv\nCOPY bash_script.sh /home/rstudio/bash_script.sh\nCOPY newRpackage_usage.R /home/rstudio/newRpackage_usage.R \n\n# however!\n# Installing the remotes package allows us to pin the version of the package we're installing\nRUN Rscript -e \"install.packages('remotes', repos = c(CRAN = 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))\"\n# now we can install a package like this:\nRUN Rscript -e \"remotes::install_version('cowsay', version='1.0.0')\"\n# this saves us the hassle of having to copy all of our project files\n# while still keeping the package versions we want!\n\nRUN echo \"Wow! There are so many things you can do with Dockerfiles!\"\nNow that you have completed your super-cool Dockerfile, you can now build your very OWN container! How exciting!\n\nBuilding and Running ‘mycontainer’\nAssuming you’ve made your own Dockerfile, you can now build your own container with this command:\ndocker build --tag mycontainer .\nNote you can replace mycontainer with whatever you would like your container to be called. Also note that it is very important to have the . at the end, as that is for your current working directory. This command will look for a Dockerfile within your current directory and then build the container.\nThe command docker images will let you see what images you have going.\nAfter you have built your container, you can now run it using:\ndocker run --rm -it -e PASSWORD=\"pizza\" -p 8787:8787 -v /$(pwd):/home/rstudio/work mycontainer\n\nNote you replacemycontainer with the name of the container you just build, and can of course replace the password.\nAlso note that the -v stands for volume. It will copy all of your local files into the container (just for you when you run it) for you to be able to use at ease.\n\nWhat if I am too lazy to type that long run command? Let’s learn about .yml files where you can run the docker in a much easier way!\n\nSide note: after you build you container you can also push it to docker so that anyone can use it\n\n\n\nRunning docker easier\nWe can create a special docker-compose.yml file where we are saved from having to write a long run command line. Note that docker specifically recognizes this file name, so the naming convention is important.\nHere is a sample of what one would look like:\nservices:\n  analysis-env:\n    image: hlan22/mycontainer\n    ports:\n      - \"8787:8787\"\n    volumes:\n      - .:/home/rstudio/work\n    environment:\n      PASSWORD: \"pizza\"\n\n# This file is a replacement for having to write the following command line\n# docker run --rm -it -e PASSWORD=\"pizza\" -p 8787:8787 \n# -v /$(pwd):/home/rstudio/work rocker/tidyverse:4.4.2\nTo run this file, you just need to type the following:\ndocker-compose up\nAlthough, with this method, you need to remove it manually afterwards with:\ndocker-compose rm",
