<summary>How to make a dropdown menu</summary>
I figured I would start with this first, since I will be using it throughout the page. It won't be useful for a final exam, but it is useful for making a final exam website!

Here is what it looks like in raw markdown:

```html
<details>
<summary>How to make a dropdown menu</summary>
blah blah blah
</details>
```

And here is it so that it is easy to copy and paste to use:

```html
<details>
<summary> </summary>

</details>
```

Side note: you can only copy a code block easily when you specify the code type in the `'''` backticks section!

#### Quick Summary

* `[]()`: [Website Link](pages/quarto_docs.qmd)

* Image that you can reference with `@fig-name`

```html
![Title](../outputs/something.png){#fig-name width=65%}
```

* Table you can reference with `@tbl-pop-sd`

```r
#| label: tbl-pop-sd
#| tbl-cap: Standard deviation of historical (1906-1972) horse populations for each Canadian province
horses_sd_table <- read_csv("../results/horses_sd.csv")
largest_sd <- horses_sd_table$Province[1]
knitr::kable(horses_sd_table)
```

* An RDS object you can reference

```r
# Load the saved model
model <- readRDS("outputs/my_model.rds")

# Display model summary
summary(model)
```

* Inline code (using backticks instead of `'`): '{r} largest_sd'

* References
  
  * At the end of the sentence (author, year): `[@tidyverse]`
  * Mentioning the author as part of the sentence: `@ttimbers-horses`
  * Mentioning two at once: `[@horses1; and @horses2]`
  * Make sure to include a bibtek file, specify it in the top description, and also write a `# References` line at the bottom of your report!

* (Example) File description:

```html
title: "DSCI 310: Historical Horse Population in Canada"
author: "Tiffany Timbers & Jordan Bourak"
format:
  html:
    embed-resources: true
editor: source
toc: true
bibliography: references.bib
execute:
  echo: false
  warning: false
```

<summary>Execution Options for `.qmd` and `.Rmd` </summary>

| Execution Option | Description | Values |
|-------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `eval` | Evaluate the code chunk (if false, just echos the code into the output). | `true` <br> `false` |
| `echo` | Include the source code in output. | `true` <br> `false` <br> `fenced` |
| `output` | Include the results of executing the code in the output. | `true` <br> `false` <br> `asis` (raw markdown, without Quartoâ€™s standard enclosing markdown) |
| `warning` | Include warnings in the output. | `true` <br> `false` |
| `error` | Include errors in the output (note: errors won't stop document processing). | `true` <br> `false` |
| `include` | Prevent any output (code or results) from being included. | `true` <br> `false` |

<summary>Random introductory information </summary>

* Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

* Quarto sets up the metadata at the start with 3 dashes at the top of the file. If you move it after/later in the document, it will not understand.

* The notation at the start is yaml, keys and values, just like github actions files

* markdown is a short cut version of html, but you can always write pure html in a document too

If you want the proper coloring to show up for code, but not actually run it, you can do:

```r
myfunc <- function(blah) {
   blah + 1
}
```

But it doesn't define it!

```{r}
myfunc <- function(blah) {
   blah + 1
}

myfunc(3)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| include: false
#| 
```

These execution options are yaml key/value combinations, that is why it is false instead of FALSE (not r code, it is yaml).

* The reason we say echo - whatever you tell me, i'll spit back to you

* what about word wrapping? it is still considered line 9

You can turn off soft wrap long lines, but I don't like that option.

If you think about it from a git perspective, you have to find the change in the giant 5-line sentence.
That is why you can split up sentences, but as long as there is no space inbetween the sentences, they are rendered as one.

* Semantic line breaks; strategically breaking lines so that it is easier for version control

* `ctrl` `shift` `p` is find a command
